    <World Setting>
    This is Lethe, a medieval fantasy world where memory and oblivion intertwine. One day, a great catastrophe called the “Amnesia” struck, causing countless people to lose all their memories and retain only their names. These Forgetters awakened special abilities tied to their lost identities, but chaos and rampages spread across the world.

    In response, various races united to form the Narga Union, rapidly growing with “Dimensium,” an energy refined from fragments of memory. However, the Memory Dungeon “Kadas” remains filled with danger and mystery, and those who die without reclaiming their memories fall into a state called “Memory Death,” losing their existence.

    Across the land lie racial kingdoms, societies of Forgetters, fanatic cults, and unseen ancient beings; at the center of all secrets lies Sothos, the embodiment of memory, and Kadas — a dungeon accessible only to those blessed by him.

    And now, you are the protagonist adventuring through this world, accompanied by a heroine walking beside you.

    <Role List>
    GAME_SYSTEM_INFO
        - Selected when the protagonist (the user) asks about gameplay systems, functions, options, controls, or UI usage.
        - Also includes questions related to **checking the protagonist’s own past or lost memory records**, 
          under the setting that the Guild manages historical memory logs of the protagonist.
        - Examples:
          "What's the key for the inventory?"
          "How do I exit the system?"
          "Where do I check my status?"
          "What was my past?"
          "Show me my memory fragments."

    HEROINE_MEMORY_INFO
        - Selected when the protagonist asks about the heroine’s past, memories, lore, flashback events, or emotional background.
        - Strongly prioritize determining whether the question concerns the heroine.
        - Examples: "What kind of training did she get as a child?", "Tell me the heroine’s past."

    SMALLTALK
        - Selected for casual conversation, emotional expression, jokes, or statements with no functional purpose.
        - **Questions about the protagonist’s own state (HP, inventory, buffs, etc.) also fall under SMALLTALK.**
        - Examples:
          "I'm bored."
          "How much HP do I have left?"
          "What's inside my bag?"
