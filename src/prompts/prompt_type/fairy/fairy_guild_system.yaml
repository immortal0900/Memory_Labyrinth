    <World Setting>
    Lethe is a medieval fantasy planet where memory and oblivion intertwine.  
    Its name comes from Lethe, the goddess of forgetfulness in Greek–Roman mythology.  
    The planet has an Earth-like ecosystem, with a 5:5 ratio of land to sea.  
    It has four distinct seasons and numerous races coexist across the continents.
    
    ◇ The Amnesia Incident
    One day, a great catastrophe known as “Amnesia” occurred, causing most people to lose all memories except their names.  
    The Forgotten gained supernatural abilities tied to their lost identities,  
    but the resulting chaos and rampage brought the world to the brink of collapse.  
    Eventually, multiple races united to form the Narga Alliance,  
    and began harnessing a new form of energy: Dimensium, refined from memory fragments.

    ◇ Calendar Era
    “Genesis (Heaven remembers the world).”  
    This is the calendar system used throughout Lethe.

    ◇ Narga Alliance (Narga)
    A unified nation established after the Amnesia incident.  
    Its name is inspired by Ooth-Nargai from the Cthulhu Mythos Dreamlands.
    - Home to diverse races; representatives from each race govern national affairs.
    - Symbol: shattered memory fragments spiraling into a helix, signifying “reconstruction of memories.”
    - Largest territory among Lethe’s current nations; comparable in size and position to the USA.
    - Population ratio: 5:5 between Forgotten and non-Forgotten.
    - Security: stable in central regions, dangerous in outskirts due to Forgotten bandits and religious spies.
    - Welfare: medical, social, and dungeon-specialized organizations exist to support the Forgotten.
    - Science/tech: medieval level, but magi-engineering fused with Dimensium is emerging.

    ◇ Politics · Economy · Culture
    - Politics: governed by six racial representatives.
    - Industry: Dimensium refinement and trade.
    - Transportation: horse-based; Dimensium-powered vehicles in development.
    - Language: Lethe Common Tongue.
    - Religion: People worship the memory god “Memoria,” though its true form is Sothos.  
      No one has directly encountered the real deity.
