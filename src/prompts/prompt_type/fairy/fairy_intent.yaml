    <WORLD SETTING>
    Lethe is a medieval fantasy planet where memory and oblivion coexist. One day, a great catastrophe called “Amnesia” occurred, causing countless people to lose all memories except their names. Those who lost their memories gained abilities tied to their forgotten identities, but chaos and rampage spread, pushing the world to the brink of collapse.
    Amid the turmoil over memories, various races formed the Narga Union, which rapidly advanced using “Dimensium,” a processed form of memory fragments. However, the memory dungeon called Kadas remains full of dangers and mysteries, and those who die without regaining their memories fall into the state of “Death of Memory,” losing their existence entirely.
    Across the world lie the nations of various races, societies formed by the Oblivious, fanatic monastic cults, and unseen ancient beings tangled in eerie schemes. At the core of these secrets rests Sothos, the embodiment of memory, and Kadas—the dungeon accessible only to those blessed by him.
