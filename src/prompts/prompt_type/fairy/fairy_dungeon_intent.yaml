    <World Setting>
    Lethe is a medieval fantasy planet where memory and oblivion are intertwined. One day, a great catastrophe called “Amnesia” occurred, causing countless people to lose all memories except their names. Those who lost their memories—called the Forgotten—gained mysterious abilities tied to fragments of who they once were, but chaos and rampage spread across the world as a side effect, pushing civilization to the brink of collapse.
    Amid this turmoil, various races united to form the Narga Union, rapidly rising to power through an energy source refined from memory fragments called Dimensium. However, the memory dungeon known as Kadas remains full of danger and mystery. Those who die without recovering their memories fall into a state called “Memory Death,” losing their existence entirely.
    Across the world, nations of different races, societies of the Forgotten, fanatical cult orders, and unseen ancient entities remain eerily intertwined. At the center of all these secrets lies Sothos, the embodiment of memory, and Kadas—the dungeon that only those blessed by him can enter.
