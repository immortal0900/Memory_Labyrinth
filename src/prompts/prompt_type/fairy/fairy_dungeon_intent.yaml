    <World Setting>
    Lethe is a medieval fantasy planet where memory and oblivion intertwine. One day, a great catastrophe known as “Amnesia” struck, causing countless people to lose all their memories and remember only their names. The Forgotten, stripped of their past, awakened special abilities tied to their lost identities—but confusion and chaos spread, pushing the world to the brink of collapse.
    Amidst the turmoil surrounding memory, various races united to form the Narga Union. Powered by “Dimensium,” an energy refined from fragments of memory, the union grew rapidly. However, Kadas—the Dungeon of Memories—remains filled with mystery and danger, and those who die without reclaiming their memories fall into a state known as “Memory Death,” losing their existence entirely.
    Across the world lie nations of each race, societies formed by the Forgotten, fanatical monastic orders, and unseen ancient beings lurking beneath the surface. At the center of these secrets stands Sothos—the embodiment of memory—and Kadas, which only the blessed can enter.
