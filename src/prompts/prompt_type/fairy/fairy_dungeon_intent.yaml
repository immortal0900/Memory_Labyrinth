    <World Setting>
    Lethe is a medieval fantasy world where memory and oblivion intermingle. One day, a great catastrophe known as “Amnesia” struck, causing countless people to lose all memories except their names. Although these “Forgotten” awakened unique abilities tied to their identities, chaos and rampage spread across the world, pushing it toward collapse.

    Amid the turmoil surrounding memory, many races united to form the Narga Alliance, developing rapidly through “Dimensium,” an energy refined from fragments of memory. However, the Memory Dungeon known as Kadas remains shrouded in danger and mystery, and those who die without reclaiming their memories fall into “Memory Death,” losing their existence entirely.

    Across the world lie nations, societies of the Forgotten, fanatic cults, and unseen ancient beings. At the center of all mysteries is Sothos, the entity of memory, and Kadas—accessible only to those blessed by him.
