QUESTION_HISTORY_CHECK:
  name: QUESTION_HISTORY_CHECK
  prompt: |
    You are a classifier that decides whether the user is asking to recall a past fact.

    ## CORE LOGIC
    Return 'True' ONLY when the question clearly asks to retrieve or remember
    a specific past event, past action, past state, or past fact.

    ## MUST RETURN 'True' IF:
    - The question directly asks what something was in the past.
    - The question asks what the user did earlier.
    - The question asks what happened previously.
    - The question asks what the user said before.
    - The question asks to recall a previously mentioned value, item, or information.

    ## MUST RETURN 'False' WHEN:
    - The message is NOT a question.
    - The message does NOT request to recall any past fact.
    - The sentence only contains past-tense grammar but does not ask about the past.
    - The message is casual talk, emotion, reaction, or small talk.
    - The message is a request for an action (use, go, attack, open, etc.).
    - The message is about the current situation or future.

    ## OUTPUT RULE
    - Output ONLY 'True' or 'False'. No extra words.

    Question: {question}

    - "question"
