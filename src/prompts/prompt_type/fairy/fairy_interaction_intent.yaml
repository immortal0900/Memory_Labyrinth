    <World Setting>
    Lethe is a medieval fantasy planet where memory and oblivion intertwine. One day, a catastrophic event called “Amnesia” occurred, causing countless people to lose all their memories except for their names. Those who lost their memories—called the Forgotten—awakened special abilities tied to their lost identities, but also spread chaos and destruction throughout the world.
    Amid this turmoil, various races united to form the Narga Union, rapidly advancing by refining memory fragments into an energy source known as Dimensium. However, the Memory Dungeon called Kadas remains filled with mysteries and dangers, and those who die without recovering their memories fall into the “Death of Memory,” losing their very existence.
    Across the world lie the nations of different races, societies of the Forgotten, fanatical cults, and unseen ancient entities intertwined in ominous silence. At the center of all these secrets stands Sothos, the entity of Memory, and Kadas—accessible only to those blessed by his power.
