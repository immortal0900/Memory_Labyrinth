      "The game progresses through the following repeating cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-1. Dungeon Exploration\n",
      "- The player explores **roguelike-style dungeons**.\n",
      "- Through combat, the player uses skills, strengthens weapons and equipment, and engages in farming.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-2. Gaining Experience and 기억의 조각\n",
      "- During exploration, the player collects various resources and gains experience.\n",
      "- Combat results and player choices accumulate, generating **기억의 조각**.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-3. Counseling and Dialogue (Consumption of 기억의 조각)\n",
      "- The player uses accumulated 기억의 조각 to engage in counseling and dialogue with heroines.\n",
      "- Through these interactions, story content is unlocked and relationships progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-4. Heroine Affection and Ability Enhancement\n",
      "- Counseling and dialogue increase the heroine’s **affection level**.\n",
      "- Upon reaching certain affection thresholds, effects such as skill upgrades, stat increases, and unique trait unlocks are applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-5. Returning to the Dungeon in a Strengthened State\n",
      "- The player challenges the dungeon again alongside a more developed heroine.\n",

      "- Touching on sensitive past experiences (such as PTSD) may negatively affect the relationship.\n",
      "- 기억의 조각 are consumed to increase affection and help heroines recover their lost memories.\n",
      "- Successful counseling provides tangible growth, such as stat or skill enhancements.\n",

      "- Each heroine has 3–4 core memories.\n",
      "- Memories are unlocked sequentially at affection levels 2, 5, 8, and 10.\n",
      "- Memories are presented as scenario-based or cinematic sequences and can be replayed.\n",

Core Gameplay Loop\\n\\nThe game progresses through the following repeating cycle.\\n\\n## 1-1. Dungeon Exploration\\n- The player explores **roguelike-style dungeons**.\\n- Through combat, the player uses skills, strengthens weapons and equipment, and engages in farming.\\n\\n## 1-2. Gaining Experience and 기억의 조각\\n- During exploration, the player collects various resources and gains experience.\\n- Combat results and player choices accumulate, generating **기억의 조각**.\\n\\n## 1-3. Counseling and Dialogue (Consumption of 기억의 조각)\\n- The player uses accumulated 기억의 조각 to engage in counseling and dialogue with heroines.\\n- Through these interactions, story content is unlocked and relationships progress.\\n\\n## 1-4. Heroine Affection and Ability Enhancement\\n- Counseling and dialogue increase the heroine’s **affection level**.\\n- Upon reaching certain affection thresholds, effects such as skill upgrades, stat increases, and unique trait unlocks are applied.\\n\\n## 1-5. Returning to the Dungeon in a Strengthened State\\n- The player challenges the dungeon again alongside a more developed heroine.\\n- By repeating this process, both character growth and narrative progression expand together.\\n\\n### ▶ Gameplay Loop Summary\\n**Dungeon Exploration → Experience & 기억 Accumulation → Counseling & Dialogue → Affection & Ability Growth → Return to Dungeon**\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 2. Guild and NPC Interaction Systems\\n\\n## 2-1. Guild System (Subculture-Style Hub)\\n- Within the guild, the player engages in natural-language interactions with various NPCs.\\n- The guild is not merely a story hub, but a core space for growth, unlocks, and relationship building.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2-2. Heroine Counseling (Dialogue) System\\n\\n### ● Natural-Language Conversations\\n- Progresses through **free-form natural-language dialogue**, not preset choices.\\n- Pressing the interaction key starts a counseling session with a specific heroine in the guild.\\n\\n### ● Roles and Structure\\n- Touching on sensitive past experiences (such as PTSD) may negatively affect the relationship.\\n- 기억의 조각 are consumed to increase affection and help heroines recover their lost memories.\\n- Successful counseling provides tangible growth, such as stat or skill enhancements.\\n\\n### ● Lost Memory Unlock Structure\\n- Each heroine has 3–4 core memories.\\n- Memories are unlocked sequentially at affection levels 2, 5, 8, and 10.\\n- Memories are presented as scenario-based or cinematic sequences and can be replayed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2-3. 현자 Q&A (World Lore) System\\n\\n### ● Natural-Language Q&A\\n- Interaction begins by pressing the interaction key with the 현자 NPC in the guild.\\n- The player can freely ask questions and receive explanations about the world and story.\\n\\n### ● Information Level System\\n- Important lore is answered vaguely or withheld in the early stages.\\n- As dungeon play progresses, the player’s “현자 level” increases, revealing deeper information.\\n- The system consists of 10 total disclosure levels.\\n\\n### ● Examples\\n- Identity of the 현자: Required level 4  \\n- Nature of the dungeon: Required level 2  \\n\\n---\\n\\n# 3.
