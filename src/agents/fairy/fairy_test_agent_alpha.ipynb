      "- The player explores **roguelike-style dungeons**.\n",
      "- Through combat, the player uses skills, strengthens weapons and equipment, and engages in farming.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-2. Gaining Experience and 기억의 조각\n",
      "- During exploration, the player collects various resources and gains experience.\n",
      "- Combat results and player choices accumulate, generating **기억의 조각**.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-3. Counseling and Dialogue (Consumption of 기억의 조각)\n",
      "- The player uses accumulated 기억의 조각 to engage in counseling and dialogue with heroines.\n",
      "- Through these interactions, story content is unlocked and relationships progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1-4. Heroine Affection and Ability Enhancement\n",
      "- Counseling and dialogue increase the heroine’s **affection level**.\n",
      "- Upon reaching certain affection thresholds, effects such as skill upgrades, stat increases, and unique trait unlocks are applied.\n",

      "## 1-5. Returning to the Dungeon in a Strengthened State\n",
      "- The player challenges the dungeon again alongside a more developed heroine.\n",

      "- Successful counseling provides tangible growth, such as stat or skill enhancements.\n",

      "- Each heroine has 3–4 core memories.\n",
      "- Memories are unlocked sequentially at affection levels 2, 5, 8, and 10.\n",
      "- Memories are presented as scenario-based or cinematic sequences and can be replayed.\n",

      "### ● Information Level System\n",
